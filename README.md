# Web-Scraping using Python - Beautiful Soup and Requests library
In this project, we scrape the URL # www.cars.com and fetch the car details for Mercedes Benz type cars. 
We send the request to URL (www.cars.com) using Python request library.
The returned response is parsed using Beautiful Soup(by creating a soup object).
Fetched details are Brand name, Mileage, Price, Rating, Rating Count and Dealer Name.
Jupyter notebook shows the code for fetching single page data as well as multiple page data(i.e. pagination).
